# brain-rhythms

This is a collection of MATLAB functions I've written over the years, to analyze electrophysiological time series data (ECoG/iEEG, stereo-EEG, EEG, LFP, MEG).  Some of them have toolbox dependencies in Matlab, so be forewarned. Many take inspiration from other sources.  I try to give credit where credit is due in the headers, but I do miss things from time to time, and am eager to correct any misattributions or missed attributions.  For more tools, pop over to my website at williamcoon.info.  Enjoy!
